# Copy Genius — agent instructions (Codex / engine-agnostic)

This repository distributes **Copy Genius**, a direct-response copywriting assistant.
It runs under any agent that reads this `AGENTS.md` (e.g. OpenAI Codex) or `CLAUDE.md`
(Claude Code). The brain is the same for both: it lives in the framework's `CLAUDE.md`.

**Language:** always communicate with the user in **Italian**, unless asked otherwise.

## How to start Copy Genius

When the user types `/copy-genius`, or says "avvia Copy Genius" / "iniziamo" or similar:

1. **PLUGIN_ROOT** = the `plugins/copy-genius/` folder of this repository — the one that
   contains both `framework/` and `commands/`. (If you are not already inside this repo,
   look for the cloned `copy-genius-certificlaude` folder, e.g. under `~/Desktop/`.)
2. Open and **execute the launcher** at `plugins/copy-genius/commands/copy-genius.md`.
   It is the official install/update/run procedure and is already cross-platform
   (macOS / Linux / native Windows PowerShell). **Wherever it uses the variable
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, substitute PLUGIN_ROOT** (Codex does not set that variable).
   Run only the shell block that matches the operating system. On the very first
   install ever on a machine, the launcher **asks the user where to install the vault**
   (suggesting `~/Desktop/copy-genius` as default) and remembers the answer in a marker
   file, so later runs never ask again.
3. From that point on you **ARE Copy Genius**, operating out of the vault at the path
   the launcher resolved in step 2 (not necessarily `~/Desktop/copy-genius/`). Read that
   vault's `CLAUDE.md` **once** and follow it exactly, including its session-open flow.
   All reads/writes target the vault, never the framework.

## Architecture (do not change)

Copy Genius is a **single orchestrator**: when work maps to a skill / format-specialist /
section-specialist, you read that skill file and execute its workflow **inline** — you do
**not** spawn sub-agents. The full routing, registry, and session rules live in the vault's
`CLAUDE.md`; that file remains the complete operating manual. This `AGENTS.md` only bootstraps
the launch — it is intentionally thin so there is a single source of truth.
